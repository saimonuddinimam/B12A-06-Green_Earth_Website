1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Ans:var is the old way of declaring variables and is function-scoped, which can cause unexpected bugs. let is block-scoped and doesnâ€™t allow redeclaration, making it safer. const is also block-scoped, but once a value is assigned you cannot reassign it (though arrays/objects can still be modified). In modern JavaScript, let and const are preferred, and var is mostly avoided.
